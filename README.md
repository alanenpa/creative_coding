Code I wrote on Making Visuals with JavaScript -course.

Every sketch file can be run locally using the canvas-sketch npm-library. \
If you have npm and canvas-sketch installed, you can run (for example)
````
canvas-sketch sketch_01.js --open
````
in your terminal to have the file open in your browser.
